[Bayes Theory : Jaynes Logic of Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6P1rjJuD_M)  A video series by Audrey Clayburn going through concepts from the book the Logic of Science (which I should read)

## Books
Books I have read with comments and notes.

#### Governing The Commons
	Elinor Ostrom 1990
	Describes Tradegy of the Commons as a version of the Prisoners Delima.
	Argues that Tragedy of the Commons situation can be avoided by locally self enforced contracts.

#### Skin in the Game
	Nassim Nicholas Taleb 2018

#### The six secrets of intelligence
	Craig Adams
	A book about deduction,  induction, analogy, reality, evidence and meaning	
	Reviews how Aristotle laid out a theory for how we think which is more fundamental than what we learn in schools today.
	Discusses how we should argue but identifying the underlying premises in an argument as these are going to be generally where differences of opinion start.
	Disagree with someone because
		- they have defined what they are talking about
		- they have changed their definition midway
		- there argument relies upon questionable assumptions
		- the reasoning probable rather than certain
		- they have been fooled by a loose analogy
	Leads towards new Modern School of Though which is 
		Kahenman, Tvserky - power of language
		Richard Nisbett - power of abstract learning
		James Flynn - power of general concepts

#### The undoing project
	Michael Lewis
	A book about Amost Tverksy and Daniel Kahneman.   Enjoyable and interesting the back story to their work.
	Enjoyed recalling aspects of Prospect Theory
		- representative heuristics
		- Availability Heuristic
	I'm now now interesting the the Features of Similarity theory.
	
#### Truth: How the Many Size to Every Stor Shape Our Reality
	Hector Macdonald

#### [The Logic of Science](./pdf/TheLogicOfScience.pdf)
	E.T. Jaynes

#### Life 3.0
	Max Tegmark
	Looks at the challenges with managing AI as it expands to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
		Matter originally was aiming dissipate (entropy)
		Then life evolved which was about replicating
		Humans are the first instance of intelligence which pursues goals of experience.
		AGI is evolution towards intelligence leaving behind dependence on biological substrate
	Lots of thought provoking ways of looking at problems.
	Author started organizing which aims to oversee development of friendly AI
	Chapter on Goals is very interesting and describes how subgoals can emerge and evolve
	Introduced me to Auto Associative Networks...well may re-introduced them to me.
	Uses the idea of 'substrate-independence' to describe how capability levels up

#### The Master Algorithm
	Perdo Domingos
	Describes machine learning in terms of 5 separate approaches.
	Very enjoyable

#### The Number Sense
	Stanislas Dehaene

#### The Outliers
	Malcolm Gladwell
	Main point is that success comes from opportunities.
	Mastery comes from 10k hours working at a skill

##### Machine Learning for Hackers
	Drew Conway & John Myles White

##### Evolution (partly read)
	Mathew Ridley

##### Superforecasting
	Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner

##### Cloud Economics.


##### Fooled by Randomness
	The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the markets.
	Nassim Nicolas Taleb
	- Enjoyable read.
	- With a random process the shorter the time scale the more bad news/misinformation there is.
	- Its not the results that matter because they are random
	- Dont be path dependent.  Always evaluate the future from the present. Dont be married to you position.
	- Evaluate the possibility of alternate worlds.

	Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford
	Modeled on 'The Goal'. Entertaining read.

##### Drift into failure.
	Sidney Dekker
	Not as good as I expected. Interesting description of Alaska airlines flight problem. Morale is to not over optimize systems as they can become brittle.

##### How not to be wrong.  Everyday mathematics
	Really enjoyed this book. Statistics, Economics, Bayes Rule.

##### The Lady Tasting Tea
	About the people involved in the development of statistics.

	Good example based on 5 mortgages which demonstrates how to the correlation between events and change the likelihoods of outcomes. Hence global financial criis.

##### Thinking in Systems
	Doneela H Meadows.
	Enjoyed this book. Author very much sees neeed to be immersed in system. Theme of non-linear ensuring complexity and chaotic behaviour.

##### Anitfragile
	Nassim Taleb

	People are myopic in their ability to pay attention, noticing only the task they are working on.

	People are bad at relating correlation to causation. Causation only determined by controlled experiment.

##### Risk Intelligence : Learning To Manage What We Dont Know
	How Frequently Do Experiences Relate To The Risk
	How relevant are these experiences to what might influence the risk?

The Master Algorithm
Perdo Domingos
Describes machine learning in terms of 5 separate approaches.
Very enjoyable

The Number Sense
Stanislas Dehaene

The Outliers
Malcolm Gladwell
Main point is that success comes from opportunities.
Mastery comes from 10k hours working at a skill

Machine Learning for Hackers
Drew Conway & John Myles White

Evolution (partly read)
Mathew Ridley

Superforecasting

Really enjoyed it. makes the point that forecasting can be improved.

Good example based on 5 mortgages which demonstrates how to the correlation between events and change the likelihoods of outcomes. Hence global financial criis.

Enjoyed this book. Author very much sees neeed to be immersed in system. Theme of non-linear ensuring complexity and chaotic behaviour.

Presents idea to concentrate on not doing wrong things. Also on the idea to look for concave functions where avg of f(x) is greater than avg x.

Stanislas Dehaene's The Number Sense.
The Empoty Raincoat : Charles Handy



How to measure anything: Douglas Hubbard
	Partially Read
	Good book what to re-read
	About Monte Carlo simulation, economic value of information.

The failure of Risk Management: Douglas Hubbard
	Ok book but relatively critical rather than constructive.
	Discusses merts and drawbacks with Black Swan arguments
	Then at the end it did become constructive and complementary of Monte Carlo simulation and Sam Savage and DISTS.


Flaw of Averages: Sam Savage.
	Great book that I really appreciate.
	Technically good.
	Describes value of options.
	Describes significant of correlation and dependency between investments.


Black Swan : Nassim Nicholas Taleb
	Very enjoyable. Really reasonates with the way that I current think.
	Not a technical book but lays out good arguments about why we are misled by conventional wisdom about linear thinking.


Everything is obvious : once you know the answer / Duncan J. Watts.
	Theme that human beings need evidence to be really obvious before we can see it.

The Invisible Gorilla.
Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons.
People are myopic in their ability to pay attention, noticing only the task they are working on.
People are overconfidently in their ability and knowledge. People think they have an understanding when then dont.
People are bad at relating correlation to causation. Causation only determined by controlled experiment.

Risk Intelligence

	How Frequently Do Experiences Relate To The Risk
	How relevant are these experiences to what might influence the risk?
	How surprising are these experiences.

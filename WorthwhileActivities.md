# Worthwhile

How to identify activity that is worthwhile to invest time, effort and money.

## Business Value
The business justification makes sense. Dont be afraid to question the value of the offering.
If it doesnt appear to make sense to develop the capability then this needs to be surface or the work is at risk.

The risk here is other can have evidence that I dont appreciate or have information that I misinterpret.

## Cost reduction

Does the outcome of the project allow the business to run more cheaply?
If this is the case there is likely to be value in the activity.

## Marketplace
There should be a market for the capability rather than just a for a specific problem for a specific customer. The capability is likely to be useful elsewhere.

The importance of this lies in being able to offer to others but also improve the capability over time.

The risk here is find people who can discuss the opportuntities and capabilities.

## Testability

It must be possible to automatically test the capability.

This is required as it allows the development of a safety net of intellectual property.

## Contemporary Technology
We are able to use contemporary technology in developing the capability.

This allows us to ensure we are not solving issues already generally solved.


## Augmentation
There is an opportunity for others to augment the capability

The ability for others to specify different data, different tests.

Are there measures when others use the capability.


## Repetition

There is the opporuntity to incrementally add value.

Some way to get feedback on the capability sooner rather than later.

A little bit of a roadback along with the capability development itself.

The repetition allows the development of the safety net along with the capability.

## Transparency
There is the opporunity to get visibility of the use of a capability.  There must be measurement when the capability is used.

This should be combined with a way to specify an expectation and then monitor for that expectation occuring or not occuring.

## Canary

There must be the opporuntity to offer it to a subset of customers/users.

Can we release this to a specific set of end users to get feedback.   Or can we release this to a random subset of users to get feedback.

The risk here is to introduce that capability to users without having to train them.

## Criticality

The introducion of errors must cause real problems.  If its possible to publish information that could be incorrect without causing issues then its likely the information is not that significant.

A lot of business problems are not critical problems.  A change of management could mean a change of direction.  The under-criticality of the capability means it wont get the required focus.


## Avoid these pitfalls

Develop documentation that users cant interact with in on a small scale to get an understanding.

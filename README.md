## 2023-012-29 Clear Thinking
Share Parrish
 
Valuable read which discusses issue with cognition and steps to break out of the cognitive short comings we all have.

`Best practices are always the best. By definition they are average`

`Avoid default thinking by creating an intentional environment where the correct behaviours are rewarded` Implication: Quality work can only be acheived by environment where quality is rewarded.

`Complaining is not a strategy. You have to work with the world as it exists, not as you would have it be: Jeff Bezos` Implication: Dont complain accept things.

`The wrong side of right`: Implication: when running a business the cost of being wrong is to great to worry about being precious about being right.

`Is this your best work`: Implication: dont review things from people if its not their best work, otherwise you are doing their work for them.

`I never allow myself to have an opinion unless I know the other sides argument better than they do: Charle Munger`: Implication: Challenge your beliefs from both sides.

`Avoid default behaviours by having a rule that requires no decision making: Daniel Kaheman` Implication: When asked for how long something will take state you have a rule that estimates arent provided without a request for an estimate.

`When a diverse set of people come together to define and solve a problem people generally solve the first problem that everyone agrees on rather than the actual problem which needs to be solved.` Implication: have separate problem definining meetings and problem solving meetings.  Spend more time discussing the problem and less time on the solution.

`Dont just imagine the future ideal outcome. Imaging things which could go wrong and how they would be overcome`

`Force yourself to think of 3 solutions to a problem and then think what if an option is not available`

`Good predictors update their beliefs as new information arises: Philip Tetlock` Implication: Have a mechanism to update beliefs (Is quality good enough?, Is this opportunity worth pursuing?)

## 2023-12-16 The Scout Mindset
Julia Galef

Enjoyed this book.
Conveyed the idea that we should seek the truth as a scout rather than become attached to our ideas and defensively seek to defend our 'beliefs' as a solider.
Did feel it didnt give me enough specific details on how to become a scout and avoid being a soldier.

## 2023-12-10 HumanKind
Rutger Bregman

Really enjoyed this book as it suggested a lot of definitive books I had read where actually misleading.

Very hopeful book suggesting that humans are naturally kind because of their ancestry.

## 2023-07-15 Risk Savy How to Make Good Decisions
Gerd Gigerenzer

Nice book which makes the case their are different domains of decisions
- those with known risks
- those where uncertainty is the dominant factor

He argues that for the decisions dominated by uncertainity, rules of thumb /heuristics are the most useful mechanism for making decisions

## Prediction Machines
The simple economics of artificial intelligence
Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans , Avi Goldfarb



## Factfullness
Hans Rosling
 
I really enjoyed this book with its positive message.
Fundamentally this is a book about the biases that exist in human though which prevent us from seeing the tremedous advancement in human well being about the last century.

The book also presented 10 specific cognitive traps we should always look out for
- Gap Instinct- be careful that gaps are drawn which mislead people.
- Negative Instinct - remember that negative information is more likely to reach us
- Fear instance - just because it is frightening doesn make is significant...if its a low risk
- Size Instinct - single large numbers can easily be misleading.  Try to look for comparisons or ratios.
- Generalization Instinct - people accept categories they are provided with rather than finding similarities between different categories or vice versa.
- Destiny Instanct - this is thinking things are concept when they are just slowly changing
- Single Perspective Instinct - realize our tendencies to see everything as a nail for our hammer.
- Blame Instinct - recognize when a scapegoat is being used
- Urgency Instance - people make bad decisions under urgency pressure. Take small steps.

## The Art of Logic : How to Make Sense in a World that Doesn't
Eugenie Cheng

I really enjoyed this book as it tackles the issue that while differences of opinion exist for good reasons 
it argues that while there can be differences in beliefs there are ways of believing and thinking and that are arguable better.

The author is a mathimatician and explains arguments in terms of how logic is applied in math.  She covers the issues that logic has as it core assumed axioms thus admits that different perspectives.  She covers the  mathimatical logic, the scientific method, analogical reasoning  as well as promoting the importance of emotion and feeling into our logical way of thinking.

### [Information Flow: The Logic of Distributed Systems](https://archive.org/details/informationflowl0000barw/page/42/mode/2up?view=theater)
Barwise, Jon, Seligman, Jerry, 2008. . In: Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science. Cambridge
University Press.



Concerned with information flow
- First principle: Information flow results from regularies in a distributed system
- Second principle: Information flow crucially involves type and their particulars
- Third princieple: It is by virtue of regulatities among connection that information abount some components of a distributed system carries information about other components
- Fouth principle: The regularities of a distributed systems are relative to its analysis in terms of information channels


### Logic and Information

### Curious
	The desire to known and why your future depends on it.
	Ian Leslie
	Very much enjoyed this book.
	Introduces concept that curiosity depends on knowledge. Hard to be curious about a topic you have little knowledge of.  Easier to be curious on a topic you have some knowledge off.
	Makes the point repeatedly how knowledge if required to gain knowledge.
	Debunks the idea that curiosity and grit alone are sufficient to become knowledgeable.  Knowledge is also required...hence importance of basic education.

### Governing The Commons
	Elinor Ostrom 1990
	Describes Tradegy of the Commons as a version of the Prisoners Delima.
	Argues that Tragedy of the Commons situation can be avoided by locally self enforced contracts.

### Skin in the Game
	Nassim Nicholas Taleb 2018

### The six secrets of intelligence
	Craig Adams
	A book about deduction,  induction, analogy, reality, evidence and meaning	
	Reviews how Aristotle laid out a theory for how we think which is more fundamental than what we learn in schools today.
	Discusses how we should argue but identifying the underlying premises in an argument as these are going to be generally where differences of opinion start.
	Disagree with someone because
		- they have not defined what they are talking about
		- they have changed their definition midway
		- there argument relies upon questionable assumptions
		- the reasoning probable rather than certain
		- they have been fooled by a loose analogy
	Leads towards new Modern School of Though which is 
		Kahenman, Tvserky - power of language
		Richard Nisbett - power of abstract learning
		James Flynn - power of general concepts

### The undoing project
	Michael Lewis
	A book about Amost Tverksy and Daniel Kahneman.   Enjoyable and interesting the back story to their work.
	Enjoyed recalling aspects of Prospect Theory
		- representative heuristics
		- Availability Heuristic
	I'm now now interesting the the Features of Similarity theory.
	
### Truth: How the Many Size to Every Story Shape Our Reality
	Hector Macdonald

### [The Logic of Science](./pdf/TheLogicOfScience.pdf)
	E.T. Jaynes

### Life 3.0
	Max Tegmark
	Looks at the challenges with managing AI as it expands to AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
		Matter originally was aiming dissipate (entropy)
		Then life evolved which was about replicating
		Humans are the first instance of intelligence which pursues goals of experience.
		AGI is evolution towards intelligence leaving behind dependence on biological substrate
	Lots of thought provoking ways of looking at problems.
	Author started organizing which aims to oversee development of friendly AI
	Chapter on Goals is very interesting and describes how subgoals can emerge and evolve
	Introduced me to Auto Associative Networks...well may re-introduced them to me.
	Uses the idea of 'substrate-independence' to describe how capability levels up
